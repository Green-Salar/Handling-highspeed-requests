# RabbitMQ

To response fast to a stream of orders, Rabbit MQ is a good choice to use. It is possible to make multiple parallel workers. Also if it is used with seprated imaginary cores of the cpu, the process will be very high in handling the requests. 
It is possible to get back answer of each at end of the work of each worker.
