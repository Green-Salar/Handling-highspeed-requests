# RabbitMQ

To response fast to a stream of orders, Rabbit MQ is a good choice to use. It is possible to make multiple parallel workers. Also if it use with seprated imaginary cores of the system the process will be very high in handling the requests. 
It is possible to get back answer of each at end of the work of each worker.
